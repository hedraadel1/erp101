This is a standard stack for building web applications, with Laravel being a popular PHP framework and Bootstrap being a popular CSS framework. The other technologies are all popular JavaScript libraries that are often used in conjunction with Laravel and Bootstrap.

I also noticed that you are using the Pusher library in your project. This suggests that you are using real-time push notifications, which is a common feature in ERP systems.

Overall, it looks like you are using a well-established and well-supported technology stack for your ERP system. Keep up the good work!
